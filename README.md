# Blood on the Clocktower Minecraft Datapack

A datapack to play **Blood on the Clocktower** in Minecraft

### Datapack status

Datapack is currently in heavy WIP state and absolutely unplayable.

In the finished version I plan to have:
- English and Russian version of the game
- Playable map with houses and chat locations
- Playable for 5-16 players (not including storyteller)
- Voicechat integration (Either [Plasmo Voice](https://modrinth.com/plugin/plasmo-voice) or [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat))
- Importable .json game scripts

### Special thanks

This datapack is heavily ispired by [Yogscast's Blood on the Clocktower videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF96Jd3Eaeg&list=PL3XZNMGhpynNejnoM0dUcoQHphz3ax00M). Special thanks to all the folks who worked on their map, datapack and all the people who made their content happen!
